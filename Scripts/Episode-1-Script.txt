Alright team, we should have enough clues for teddie to find rise,
were going into the TV world and finding her before it's too late

Got it partner, just say the word and we'll follow your lead, we gotta save Rise as soon as we can!

Wait before we go, yosuke can you get me some more steak? I'm SOOOOO hungry!

Dude! Chie! We just ate 10 minutes ago! How does your stomach even have space!

God Yosuke stop moaning and get me some more food! Don't you listen to king morons biology lessons? 
The more you exercise and move the more you need to eat! 

But you freakin ate 2 steaks, 3 chicken sandwiches, 4 portions of fries, a chocolate milkshake, 2 large sodas and-

Yosuke shut it! Maybe if your fat ass stopped tugging it to pictures of idols in swimsuits all day
and did some exercise, your stupid coomer brain will understand the eternal hunger i'm going through! 

Hehe coomer

Wait, is that true senpai?

Stay out of this Yukiko! And no Kanji! I don't just sit on my ass staring at porn all day, I aint got time for 
that, especially after the 2 new hires left only after a week! Who the hell do you think stocks 
the shelves in the groceries section of junes? 

Guys please, can we stop arguing for a moment

ohhh wait! I get it! That's why you're in such a hurry to find rise! Your pervy dog ass wants to save rise so 
she has to give you something in return! Maybe getting on her knees to suck you off?

Whoa What! Are you seriously objectifying risette? You think all i see in her is a sex doll?!
I have never, ever! imagined risette wrapping her delicate, soft, luscious lips on my fat, juicy Cock!

hahahahah cock!

ewwww Yosuke! no one wants to hear about your smelly dicky! and even if that was true,
that still dosen't excuse you from fat shaming me and not giving a rats ass about MY WELLBEING!

Chie! Yosuke! can we all calm down for a second, this is all not a joke.

actually senpai, this is the most fun I've had in a while!

Kanji keep your mouth shut! we're not arguing for your entertainment!

Yea you're not involved in this! why dont you do us all a favour and shove a 12 inch dragon dildo down your throat so 
we don't have to hear your annoying voice!

wooo oh, Ok, that's it senpais, you must all think youre all hot shit
if you think you can get away disrespecting me by dropping your pants 
and fucking me in the mouth!

uhh.. no one is going to be doing any of that..

PISS off! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't pick up this chair and bash all your tiny skulls in!

KANJI IF YOU DON'T PIPE DOWN RIGHT NOW I'LL GALAXY PUNT YOU IN THE CROTCH SOOOO HARD YOU'LL HAVE TO LEGALLY CHANGE
YOUR GENDER TO A GIRL!

KANJI FOR CRYING OUT LOUD NO ONE IS DOING ANY OF THAT TO YOU!

OH IS THAT SO! WELL OK SINCE YOU SO KINDLY VOLUNTERED YOSUKE SENPAI, HOW ABOUT YOU

PARTNER! ANYONE HELP ME!

(HAHAHAHAHAHAH)

Everyone enough!

Rise's life is in danger! Remember Why we formed the
Investigation Team? We're the only ones with the power to stop anyone else getting killed in Inaba!
None of us can do this alone, so lets change our rage to a smarter greater cause and 
focus on saving Rise!

You're right partner.. sorry Chie, I guess you won't be able to fight properly 
on a hungry stomach, even if you did just eat out half of my month's allowance...

I'm sorry too Yosuke... I was just being a hangry bitch, I appreciate all the
food you've given us all, I can wait a while until the next mealtime to start
chowing down on some more steak!

Yea I'm sorry too! for uhh... wait what did I do?

Don't worry about it Kanji, just don't be throwing anymore chairs around and trying to eat my ass again.

Sure Senpai! I'll try my best to not throw anymore chairs!

And trying to eat my ass, Kanji I need to know that you're 100% sure you're not going to do that again...

...

...

..

Why's everyone staring at me? Is there something on my face?

Uhh yukiko, ar'nt you gonna apologize too? maybe for laughing like a disabled hyena the whole time?

oh that! ok i guess I'll apologize, I'm sooooo sorry for not being able to control myself laughing at that
batshit crazy argument, it was absolutely hilarious seeing everyone unrealistically overreact over the smallest things!

Well thats a good enough apology for me

OH COME ON! Can't you be a little harder on her leader?

Can't you see how apologetic Yukiko is?

(snickering)

goodd! whatever! you're too nice sometimes!

Can we just go already!

Alright, follow my lead everyone.

(go into the tv)
 
everyone! I thought you guys would never come back!
It's been too long!

sup teddie! How've you been hanging!

Oh hanging! as in the act of my lifeless body on a noose 
when I don't see you guys for a week!

hey, that was a joke right?

Yea! just a joke!

well, moving on. Teddie, we found out some clues that'll help in finding Rise's scent, 
will you be able to sniff her out?

Oh why certainly sensei! I just wish you guys were just as eager to find rise
as you would be seeing me before I offed myself!

Woah Ok (everyone)

Teddie.. are you alright? Is there anything you want to us talk about? 

Yea if anything's bothering you, please tell us, we won't judge you.

I was just joking around! its nothing serious you guys! All I've been doing 
for the past week was passing the time on Sorrow Solution, reddit and watching
Al qeada executions all day!

(execution on laptop)

Holy moly! who gave Teddie a laptop with unrestricted internet access?

I know right! How could you Teddie! going on Reddit is the cringeist thing you could
ever do online! 

God I think I'm gonna puke, I can't believe you're a reddit user!

Ok guys there's nothing wrong with reddit.. The problem is that he's 
addicted to seeing al Qaeda chopping dudes heads chopped off!

What's an al-Qaeda?

Oh it was the terrorist group behind the 9/11 attacks, Remember Kanji?
They flew two planes straight into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York.

but i thought the US government did it! jet fuel can't melt steel beams!

I was the one who gave the laptop to him, I thought it would help him
learn more about the world outside, but I really didn't think he would
become an edge lord.

Well great going leader! Now his brain is filled with degenerate nonsense!

Shut up Woman! Get back into the kitchen and make me a sandwich!

Oh and he's sexist too, obviously!

Teddie, just stop trying to be edgy from now on.

alright sensei... but I was just trying to be based and red-pilled!

yeaaa he's never getting that laptop back

Ok back to where we left off, you're trying to smell the scent of a teenage idol with identity issues
and body dysmorphia.

Oh! Does she have a septum piercing, tattoos and believes in astrology?

no she dosen't...

whoops! so we're not looking for a girl with daddy issues! 
In that case, i smell I really strong odour in that direction!

Really! Nice one teddie!

Everyone follow me!

So this is Rise's palace,

Dude what is this place? Is this a strip club?!

Does this mean we get to see lots of naked boobies!

Oh I hope so!

Guys there will be no boobies! 

(awww)

yea, this place is a nice fit for a promiscuous slut like her!

wow Are you jealous Yukiko? what was that comment?

Well I just think it's not very lady like of her to be dressing up like that 
and putting your body on display for everyone to simp over!

Ohoho, is someone scared they won't be the top bitch in school anymore!

Rise chan!

Everyeone please! don't look!

That must be her shadow!

right you are pretty boy!

wait, im I a pretty boy too rise?

....

Yukiko, just admit it, the moment I walk into your school, 
All your beta orbiters will come grovelling to their new queen!
(really are you just gonna ignore me!)
(Shut it you horny bastard!)
(Ow chie!)

hahahaha Why would I be scared of you? If you really
want to be surrounded by sweaty gamer boys all day with their horrific stench,
then by all means be my guest!

Why, I think I'll take you up on that offer...
Hey boys, like something you see!

NO stop! Everyone please look away!

why are you all still staring!

oh uh no nothing (yep nothing) 
we weren't looking at anything!

Stop it right now! you're just a shadow!

oh no! don't say it!

You're not me!
