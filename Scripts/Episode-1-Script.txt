Alright team, we should have enough leads for teddie to locate rise,
we know the plan, were going into the TV world and finding her before it's too late

Got it partner, just say the word and we'll follow your lead, we gotta save Rise as soon as we can!

Wait before we go, yosuke can you get me some more steak? I'm SOOOOO hungry!

Dude! Chie! We just ate 10 minutes ago! How does your stomach still have space?!

God Yosuke stop moaning and get me some more food! Don't you listen to king morons biology lessons? 
The more you exercise and move the more you need to eat! 

But you literally ate 2 steaks, 3 chicken sandwiches, 4 portions of fries, a chocolate milkshake, 2 large sodas and-

Oh shut it! Maybe if you stopped beating your meat to pictures of idols in swimsuits all day,
went outside and touched grass, your stupid coomer brain will understand the eternal hunger i'm going through! 

Hehe coomer

Wait, is that true senpai?

Stay out of this Yukiko! And no Kanji! I don't just sit on my ass staring at porn all day, I aint got time for 
that, especially after the 2 new hires left only after a week! Who the hell do you think stocks 
the shelves in the groceries section of junes? 

Guys please, can we stop arguing for a moment

ohhh wait! I get it! That's why you're in such a hurry to find rise! Your pervy dog ass wants to save rise so 
she has to give you something in return! Maybe getting on her knees to suck you off?

Whoa What! Hey my unhealthy crippling addiction to cute idols has nothing to do with any agenda like that!
And I definitely have never, ever! imagined rise wrapping her delicate, soft, luscious lips on my fat, veiny, juicy Co-

Yosuke dont finish that sentence

hahahahah cock!

Yukiko, that isnt funny... 

Oh sureeee, I totally believe you! and even if that was true,
that still dosen't excuse yuo from fat shaming me and not giving a rats ass about MY WELLBEING!

Chie! Yosuke! can we all calm down for a second, this is all not a joke.

actually senpai, this is the most fun I've had in a while!

Kanji keep your mouth shut! we're not arguing for your entertainment!

Yea you're not involved in this! why dont you do us all a favour and shove a 12 inch cucumber down your throat so 
we don't have to hear you speak again!

wooo oh, Ok, that's it senpais, you must all think youre all hot shit
if you think you can get away disrespecting me by dropping your pants 
and fucking me in the mouth!

uhh.. no one is doing any of that..

PISS off! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't pick up this chair and bash all your tiny fucking skulls in!

KANJI IF YOU DON'T PIPE DOWN RIGHT NOW I'LL GALAXY PUNT YOU IN THE CROTCH SOOOO HARD YOU'LL HAVE TO LEGALLY CHANGE
YOUR GENDER TO A GIRL!

actually, i wouldnt mind that...

KANJI FOR GOODNESS SAKE NO ONE IS DOING ANY OF THAT TO YOU!

OH IS THAT SO! WELL OK SINCE YOU SO KINDLY VOLUNTERED YOSUKE SENPAI, HOW ABOUT YOU
ENJOY THE KANJI'S SPECIAL! CHAIR TO THE FACE!

WOAH DUDE, WHAT THE HELL!! YOU COULD OF SERIOUSLY BUSTED MY FACE UP!

(HAHAHAHAHAHAH)

Everyone enough!

Rise's life is in danger! Rememeber Why we formed the
Investigation Team? We're the only ones with the power to stop anyone else getting killed, 
None of us can do this alone, so lets change our rage to a smarter greater cause and 
focus on saving Rise!

You're right partner.. sorry Chie, I guess you won't be able to fight properly 
on an empty stomach, even though you did eat half of the food courts stock..

I'm sorry too Yosuke... I was just being a hangry bitch, I appreciate all the
food you've given us all, I can wait a while until the next mealtime to start
chowing down some more steak.

Yea I'm sorry too! for uhh... wait what did I do?

Don't worry about it Kanji, just don't be throwing chairs around and trying to eat my ass anymore please!

Sure Senpai! I'll try my best to not throw anymore chairs!

And trying to eat my ass, Kanji I need to know you're 100% sure you're not going to do that again...

...

...

..

Why's everyone staring at me? Is there something on my face?

Uhh yukiko, arnt you gonna apologise? for laughing like a crippled hyena the whole time?

Why would I? It was absolutely hilarious seeing everyone unrealistically overreact over the smallest things!
But i guess I'll apologise, I'm sooooo sorry for not being able to control myself laughing at
the batshit crazy drama act you have so wonderfully acted out in front of me!

Well thats a good enough apology for me

OH COME ON! Can't you be a little harder on her leader?

Can't you see how apologetic Yukiko is?

(snickering)

Oh godd! whatever! you're too nice sometimes!

Can we just go already!

Alright, Team Investigation team, roll out!

(go into the tv)

By the way, leader, can I comment on your last line? 

Sure Yukiko, what did you want to say about it-

Yea it was cringe, really a transformers reference? 4/10 please never say that again.

Since when did you become the funny police Yukiko! wernt you laughing at the words cock and balls earlier?

(hehehe)

Oh everyone! I thought you guys would never come back!
It's been too long!

Hey teddie! How've you been hanging!

Oh hanging! as in the act of my lifeless body on a noose 
when I don't see you guys for a week!

....

umm, Anyways. Teddie, we found some clues that'll help in finding Rise's scent, 
will you be able to sniff her out now!

Oh why certainly sensei!
